   - Follow the coding style (run `cargo fmt`)
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed

4. **Test Your Changes**

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.85.0 or later
- cargo-deny (optional): `cargo install cargo-deny`
- cargo-tarpaulin (optional, for coverage): `cargo install cargo-tarpaulin`

### Building

```bash
cargo build --workspace
```

### Running Tests

```bash
cargo test --workspace
```

### Running Examples

```bash
cargo run --example hello_world
```

### Developer Tasks

Use the `xtask` utility for common tasks:

```bash
cargo xtask fmt      # Format code
cargo xtask lint     # Run clippy
cargo xtask test     # Run tests
cargo xtask doc      # Build docs
cargo xtask check    # Run all checks
```

## Coding Standards

### Rust Style

- Follow the [Rust Style Guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/style-guide/)
- Run `cargo fmt` before committing
- Ensure `cargo clippy` passes without warnings

### Code Organization

- Keep functions small and focused
- Use descriptive variable names
- Add inline comments for complex logic
- Group related functionality into modules

### Documentation

- Document all public APIs with doc comments
- Include examples in doc comments where helpful
- Use `///` for item documentation
- Use `//!` for module documentation

### Testing

- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Use property-based tests where appropriate (with `proptest`)
- Add integration tests for complex features
- Include snapshot tests for widget rendering (with `insta`)

### Performance

- Avoid unnecessary allocations
- Use `&str` instead of `String` where possible
- Leverage `Cow` for flexible ownership
- Profile code for hotspots before optimizing
